                  I am a senior at the <a href="https://stthomas.edu" target="_blank">University of St. Thomas</a> earning my
                  double major in computer science and computer engineering. In
                  my engineering senior design program I am getting the
                  opportunity to do design work for <a href="https://www.polaris.com/en-us/" target="_blank">Polaris</a>. In my computer
                  science senior design course I am gaining experience in web
                  development. This aligns with the experience I gained the past
                  two summers working as a full-stack software engineering
                  intern at <a href="https://www.medtronic.com/en-us/index.html" target="_blank">Medtronic</a>.

                  I am an active member of my University’s <a href="https://www.ieee.org/" target="_blank">Institute of
                  Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</a> chapter. I served
                  as the Event Coordinator from October 2023 to May 2024 where I
                  took over as President. Since taking over as President I have
                  worked towards building community and hosting more frequent
                  events. In my time as President I have increased average
                  attendance by 107% and increased event frequency by 41%.

                  As part of my engineering studies at the University of St.
                  Thomas I had the opportunity to study in Seoul, South Korea
                  for a month. I was taking an engineering course called
                  "High-Tech Manufacturing, Engineering, and Society". Through
                  this I gained an understanding of global engineering and had
                  the opportunity to tour manufacturing sites for Hyundai
                  Motors, Hyundai Heavy Industry, LG, iLabs, and Telstar.

                  I am also an active member of the <a href="https://swe.org/" target="_blank">Society of Women Engineers
                  (SWE)</a>. As a freshman in high school, I had the opportunity to
                  attend the SWE conference for the first time. When I got to
                  college I joined my University’s SWE board. As a board member,
                  I had the opportunity to attend the SWE conference in Chicago
                  last year and in New Orleans this year. This has given me the
                  opportunity to network and gain community within the field of
                  engineering.
